### In Python, a function is a named block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It is defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name and a set of parentheses that may include parameters.
### The function body contains indented statements that execute when the function is called. Functions may optionally return a value using the return statement.
### So in this lesson,  weâ€™ll take a look at python built-in functions and user-defined functions.
